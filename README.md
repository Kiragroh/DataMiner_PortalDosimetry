# DataMiner_PortalDosimetry
(Standalone-Console-App)
Mine all analysed PortalDosimetry Fields and make custom evaluations too. Have Fun.

Installation notes:

1.) Add three .dll-files to your dependecies normally found in C:\Program Files (x86)\Varian\ProductLine\Workspaces\VMS.PortalDosimetry.Workspace\
- PortalDosimetry.dll
- VMS.CA.Scripting.dll
- VMS.DV.PD.Scripting.dll

2.) Change Network-Path in Line 310 and 312 to your liking. Otherwise your file will be created in Temp-Path

Note:
- script is optimized to work with Eclipse 15.1
- absolute beginner should first read my beginnerGuide
